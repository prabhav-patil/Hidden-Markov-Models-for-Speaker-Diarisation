# Hidden-Markov-Models-for-Speaker-Diarisation
Speaker  diarisation  is   the  task of  segmentation  of  an  audio  stream,  which  is  created  by  multiple speakers speaking at different times and for different durations. 
It can be solved using Hidden Markov Models and related models. 
We have used three variants of Hidden Markov Models:
1. Standard HMM
2. Autoregressive HMM
3. Sticky HMM

which we have mplemented on speaker diarisation dataset extracted from IB4010 audiofile, from the AMI Corpus Library
